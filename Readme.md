# projectNice: The Game by Cardboard Coders
The quest of one lonely ship for infinite knowledge.  
The story of useless factoids threating the _status quo_. And by extrapolation... **_the entire world_**.

## The Story So Far
The Akashic records have been unlocked and are flooding the Earth! Tapping into the source of information will help save every living creature from excitotoxicity!  
Become a silent guardian. A watchful protector. Because you are the hero they deserve and need right now.

## The Goal
Challenge your skills by:
- Typing like a hacker
- Learning factoids
- Achieving supremacy over that random fb share with a 42% accuracy
- Noticing we only have english-written factoids
- Wondering why we failed to add multiplayer during the hackathon
- And many more!

## The Stack
The Akashic records have been largely created with the help of [Freebase](https://www.freebase.com/)  
The game engine used is [Phaser](https://phaser.io)  
The audio are courtesy of [Freesound](https://www.freesound.org/) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)  
All graphics are built by the cardboard coders.

A special shoutout to:
- [Aiwha@Freesound](https://www.freesound.org/people/Aiwha/sounds/250712/) for the explosion sound (kaboom-boom)
- [Timbre@Freesound](https://www.freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/172591/) for the laser sound (ptiu ptiu)
- [Koori Graywolf@Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/koori-graywolf) for the majority of our background music (chillin', relaxing... chillazxing)
- [Ridley Scott@Alien](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=In+space,+no+one+can+hear+you+scream.) for space-sound-physics (we ignored it)

## The Global Hackathon@Koding.com
[![Koding Hackathon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koding/hackathon.submit/master/images/badge.png "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)  
We wanted to help with the ever present problem of learning and education. By enticing users into playing a game, we strongly believe curiosity is a great motivator towards new knowledge.  
We always wanted to collaborate and build a game together.

Koding's hackathon felt like a match made in heaven. By using the popular mechanics of keyboard shoot'em'ups we felt we could accomplish our goal.

We were wrong. Our initial idea had a ton of bells and whistles. We trimmed the fat, we got to a very simplistic MVP which was fun to both build and play. We gained a lot of exp in how to properly collaborate, but a little to late.

We completely lack the multiplayer version we envisioned. Maybe next weekend we'll add some of the features we didn't find the time to finish.

Overly Sincerely,
The Cardboard Coders
